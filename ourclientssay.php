								Rapid Data Recovery have given me a quick, accurate and friendly service every time.

								Rapid Data Recovery did a fantastic job and I have all my music, movies, wedding photos and data back where they belong.

								I can't stress enough how amazing these guys are. I am a professional wedding photographer and I had an incident where my Kingston Memory card failed at an extremely inconvenient time. Luckily I found Rapid Data Recovery who, within 3 days, had recovered my data. Put simply, if not for Rapid Data Recovery I would no longer be in business.

								I was very pleased with the service that I received from Rapid Data Recovery. All of my data was successfully recovered for just £97. I would highly recommend their services.

								I kept meaning to back up vital documents but never got round to it. Everyone else had given up trying to recover the data, or were charging too much. Rapid Data were friendly, efficient and fast - all data recovered in a few days at a realistic price. I'm delighted with the service - and have no hesitation recommending Rapid Data to anyone

								Rapid Data Recovery offers a service that is second to none! We despatched the hard drive to RDR and within a couple of days had a telephone conversation outlining what had been found and the likely costs of recovery. Once given the go ahead I was amazed to find a mail only a couple days after that taking me to a link where the recovered data could be examined. first class service, one you may not want to come across but it’s reassuring to know it’s there!

								I'm a registered blind person with just a little residual vision, and whilst moving our family photos and my very extensive audio book library onto my WD My Book 3TB HDD. On completion the drive packed up leaving me with nothing. 1.5TB and all of it gone. I contacted Rapid Data Recovery, who were confident that they could at least be able to recover some of my lost items. This turned out to be the case, with just a minute loss of data.
